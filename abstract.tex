%There are numerous motivations for volunteer contributions to crowdsourced  such as wikis, blogs, open-source software, Citizen Science projects, or Internet forums\cite{moore-2007}. We investigate the values and motivations associated with contributing to Over a nine month period, we collected X information submissions about Y unique bus stops in the greater Seattle area.

We draw upon Value Sensitive Design theory and methodology to investigate community members' motivations for entering landmark information about bus stops through an application called StopInfo. A formative study identified the value of \emph{community} as important to many past and potential StopInfo contributors. We explore this value and others further in second round conceptual and empirical investigations centered around people who have previously contributed stop information to StopInfo, as well as with people who use the app but have never contributed information. Lastly, we evaluate our technology with respect to these values and explore possible designs of StopInfo mechanisms that better support values associated with community.
