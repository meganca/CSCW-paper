\section{Acknowledgements}
We would like to extend our thanks to a number of individuals who helped move our project along: Batya Friedman, for lending her expertise on Value Sensitive Design and her suggestions for its incorporation into our project; Ryan Drapeau for helping us conduct some of our interviews; and the rest of the individuals in INSC 543 for their valuable feedback on the project. Many thanks to King County Metro for their collaboration on the StopInfo system, particularly Matthew Weidner and Melanie Joyce. We would also like to thank Ford Motors Company for the financial support for much of this work and the press they generated for us, as well as Seattle Transit Blog board members for allowing us to endlessly recruit on their blog. Lastly, thanks is owed to all of the open-source developers on the OneBusAway project: Sean Barbeau, Aaron Brethorst, Aengus McMillan, and others who continue to improve the system on a volunteer basis.
